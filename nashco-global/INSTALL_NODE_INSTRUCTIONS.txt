I attempted to download and install Node.js LTS but the installer requires elevation.

Downloaded MSI path (temp):
C:\Users\sweji\AppData\Local\Temp\nodev24.12.0.msi

Next steps you can take (pick one):
1) Run the installer manually as Administrator:
   - Right-click the MSI and choose "Run as administrator" to install.

2) Let me re-run the installer and prompt for elevation (this will show a UAC prompt):
   - I can run a command that invokes the installer with elevation. Confirm if okay.

3) Install Node manually using the official installer from https://nodejs.org (LTS recommended).

After Node is installed, I can:
- Run `npm init -y` and install OpenTelemetry deps.
- Create `tracing.js` and add an npm `trace` script.
- Delegate follow-up tasks to a cloud agent if you want.

Tell me which option to proceed with, or if you want me to attempt the elevated install now.
